Thia project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of calories burned during physical activity based on various physiological and activity-related parameters. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically regression modeling, we analyze a dataset containing information such as age, gender, height, weight, duration of activity, heart rate, and body temperature. Through this project, we seek to understand the factors influencing calorie expenditure and provide individuals with a tool to better track and manage their fitness goals. Our model's accuracy will be assessed using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²), ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in estimating calorie burn.
